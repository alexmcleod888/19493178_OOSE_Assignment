Task:
Design and implement a system for helping to coordinate election campaigns using
social media.
Your client, and prospective sole user, is the chief “political strategist” for a political
party; let’s call it the Australian Hedonism Party. During an election campaign, they
must manage a large team of volunteers, and devise “talking points” for those in the
Australian Hedonism Party to follow.
However, election campaigns can also be very fast-moving and quickly-changing, and
social media has become a powerful force. Your client needs an automated system
to monitor Twitter and Facebook for a series of keywords, so they can organise rapid
responses to trending issues. In addition, the system must be able to notify a range of
people via Twitter, Facebook or SMS.
